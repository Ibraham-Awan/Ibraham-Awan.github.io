	<h2> One of the many best things I have discovered in life is the sport of Basketball, I love playing this sport becasue it eases my mind and helps me become a better person mentality it helps me be more motivated to chase my dreams and to stay active. Basketball is a sport I was inspired by my Uncle, he introduced me to the sport and I started playing with him when I was around 5 years old.</h2>
	
<p> This is the Basketball court where I first started playing, it has changed and improved alot since I was little.</p>
